# Divergence RSI Trader EA

This is a sample code for the Divergence RSI Trader Expert Advisor (EA). Please note that Forex Robot Easy is not the official developer of this product. We are only providing a sample code that can work as described in the product.

## Product Description

The Divergence RSI Trader EA is an automated trading system that identifies divergences in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator and generates trading signals based on these divergences. The EA is designed to work on the EURUSD currency pair and the H1 timeframe, but these settings can be customized.

The main features of the Divergence RSI Trader EA are as follows:

1. Divergence Detection: The EA uses the RSI indicator with a period of 14 to detect divergences between the price and the RSI. It checks for divergences where the price makes a higher high or a lower low, while the RSI makes a lower high or a higher low.

2. Risk Management: The EA implements a risk management strategy to limit the risk exposure of each trade. The maximum risk per trade is set to 2% of the account balance. The trade volume is calculated based on the maximum risk amount and the margin requirements of the symbol.

3. Stop Loss and Take Profit: The EA sets stop loss and take profit levels for each trade. The stop loss level is set at 100 pips from the entry price, and the take profit level is set at 200 pips from the entry price. These levels are customizable.

4. Trade Execution: The EA opens trades when a divergence is detected. If the price makes a higher high and the RSI is above the threshold of 70, a buy trade is opened. If the price makes a lower low and the RSI is below the threshold of (100 - RSI_THRESHOLD), a sell trade is opened.

5. Trade Management: The EA closes all open trades when the CloseTrade() function is called. This function can be called manually or by adding additional logic based on specific conditions.
